Project: Peer Assessment System

We aim to build a website destined for students and professors, and that is to be used for team projects. Through this website, students will be able to rate their teammates'contributions and perfomance based on: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution and work ethic. Here are the key features:

 - Students assessments: possibility to log in, anonymous evaluation of teammates for specific projects, evaluation on a 7-point scale
    
 - Automated Score Sharing and Anonymous Peer Feedback: professor can see each student's overall assessment of their teammates, each student's evaluation results are shared with them
    
- Instructor Dashboard: instructors can create teams and access the assessments by team/by student, results can be converted to CSV files
